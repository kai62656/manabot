##2MOUSE:

 Left click to execute default action: walk, pick up an item, attack a monster
 and talk to NPCs (be sure to click on their feet). Right click to show up a
 context menu. Holding [Left Shift] prevents from walking when attacking.


##2COMMUNICATION:

 Communication is often essential to success in this game. You can communicate
 in several ways:  By chatting and showing emotions (see above), by trading
 (with the right-click context menu), and by whispering.

 To whisper, type

 /whisper <name> <message>

 This will send <message> to player <name>, if that player is logged in. If the
 name has a space in it, put double quotes around it like this:

 /whisper "<name>" <message>

 For further help type /help in the chat console.


##2IGNORING COMMUNICATION

 You may find that not all communication is to your liking.  While most people
 are nice, some may offend you or try to make your life harder-- since this is
 an open game, there is nothing the developers can do to prevent this.

 However, you can protect yourself from such players by ignoring them.  Right-
 click on them to bring up the context menu, then select `Ignore' or
 `Disregard' (see below).  You can fine-tune your player relations in the
 `Setup' menu, which lists all the players you have added to it.  To open this
 menu, select `Setup' in the upper right corner of the screen, then `Players'.

 There you will find a list of all players you are acquainted with, as well as
 several configuration options:

 - ##2save player list##P: Should your acquaintance list be saved when you
   quit the game?  If you enable this option, your list will survive when you
   quit and re-start.
 - ##2allow trading##P: Do you wish to allow trade requests from arbitrary
   players?
 - ##2allow whispers##P: Do you wish to allow arbitrary players to send
   private messages to you in-game?

##2THE PLAYER LIST

 The player list lists all of your acquaintances.  They are categorised as one
 of the following:

 - ##2neutral##P:  As far as the game is concerned, this is the same as not
   having the player listed:  the player may chat with you, but may only trade
   or whisper if you have this option allowed for everyone.
 - ##2friend##P:  You consider this player a friend.  The player may chat,
   message your in private, or trade with you at any point.
 - ##2disregarded##P:  You wish to disregard this player, meaning that his or
   her chat messages are not logged and trade requests and whispers are
   ignored.
 - ##2ignored##P:  You wish to completely ignore this player.  You will not
   even see floating text for him or her anymore, nor emotions.
