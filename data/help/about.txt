##3                      === ABOUT THE MANA WORLD ===
 
 ##2The Mana World (TMW)##P is a serious effort to create an innovative free
 and open source MMORPG. TMW uses 2D graphics and aims to create a
 large and diverse interactive world. It is licensed under the GPL,
 making sure this game can't ever run away from you.
 
 The project includes the development of both a client and a server,
 as well as the development of an online world. At the moment we're
 making alpha releases of the client, while our server is in early
 development. The eAthena free software Ragnarok Online server is used
 until our own server has matured enough to replace it. Once ready,
 we'll be making releases of our server too so anybody will be free to
 set up their own server and start building their own online world.
