F.A.Q.

HELP

Q: How to get help?

A: The fastest way is to come on our IRC channel. There you can find a lot of
   nice people that will help you until you solve your problem.

     Server: irc.freenode.net  Channel: #themanaworld.

   If you don't like IRC just come to our forums:

     http://forums.themanaworld.org.

   Ok, do you think forums are evil? Don't worry, send us an e-mail at
   themanaworld-devel@lists.sourceforge.net and you're done. That's not enough?
   No, we don't share our phone numbers! ;P


GAME

Q: I always get "Unregistered ID" error message, why?

A: Is the first time you login? Have you registered an account? If not use the
   "Register" button. If you already succesfully connected before, but now
   you're getting this message, please get in touch (see "How to get help").

Q: I always get "Wrong password" but I'm sure I typed it right, why?

A: If is the first time you login be sure you're not adding _M at the end of
   your username. Otherwise just get in touch (see "How to get help").

Q: How can I talk to NPCs?

A: Did you read README? Are you really sure? If not go read it and you'll find
   all the known commands. Or just press F1 in game. If you notice the
   README/ingame help is not up to date/wrong, please report it to the
   developers.

Q: I can't recover HP anymore.

A: Check your inventory, if you've got lots of stuff probably you're
   overweight, try to give away some of them. You get overweight when you're
   carrying 50% of your maximum weight.


Git

Q: What's Git?

A: It's a system where is stored the latest development version. It's not
   assured that it's stable, but surely it has the latest updates. (Git version
   is updated quite frequently). If you want to check it out, read this guide

DEVELOPMENT

Q: When will the next version be released?

A: We don't have scheduled releases, but usually a new release is available
   every few months. Check http://themanaworld.org/ for further info.
