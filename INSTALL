1. Requirements
===============

You are expected to have either checked out TMW from Git or you have downloaded
a source release. To get The Mana World to compile, you need a compiler (GCC)
and some libraries. The required libraries are:

* SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
* SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* SDL_net           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
* SDL_ttf           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
* ENet 1.2          http://enet.bespin.org/
* Guichan 0.8.x     http://guichan.sourceforge.net/
* libxml2           http://www.xmlsoft.org/
* physfs 1.x        http://icculus.org/physfs/
* zlib 1.2.x        http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
* libcurl           http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

If you've cloned the Git repository, you will also need these tools to compile:

* GNU automake 1.9  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
* GNU autoconf      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
* GNU gettext       http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
* CVS               http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ (needed to run autopoint)

On some machines, it's been reported that this package is also needed. However,
you might not need it:

* GNU libtool       http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

Installing these dependencies is distributions-specific, and we'll leave it to
you to figure this out.


2. Compiling And Installing The Mana World
==========================================

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
2) If you've cloned the Git repository, run "autoreconf -i" to generate
   configure and install any missing auxiliary files.
3) Run "./configure"
4) Run "make"
5) Run "make install" as root

It should have installed The Mana World on your system now, and you can run it
with "tmw". By default all files are installed to /usr/local, you can pass a
different prefix to configure as usual.


  NOTE: It is possible to compile TMW without support for OpenGL rendering.
  To do this perform step 3 as follows:

    ./configure --without-opengl

  Rebuild the executable from scratch using "make clean" and then "make".


  NOTE: This version of TMW can be compiled with support for connecting to
  tmwserv, a server developed from scratch by the TMW project. However, the
  client won't support eAthena anymore when you do. In future clients we
  intend to support either server from a single compile.

  To configure the client with support for tmwserv, do step 3 as follows:

    ./configure --with-server=tmwserv
